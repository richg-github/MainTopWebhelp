A device can be a Smartphone, desktop computer, or any device that is capable of receiving an alert by e-mail.',l:''},'Alert Logic Security Operations Center':{d:'The Alert Logic Security Operations Center (SOC) is staffed 24x7x365 by highly-trained security professionals who have extensive experience in intrusion detection and security architecture. SOC analysts hold Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certifications and Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) certifications in intrusion analysis and incident handling.',l:''},'AMI':{d:'Amazon machine image',l:''},'auto scaling':{d:'Automatically scaling resources up or down based on demand.',l:''},'CFT':{d:'Cloud Formation Template',l:''},'critical asset':{d:'A critical asset is a specific entity of such importance that tampering with, destroying, or incapacitating the asset, will have a serious effect on your security posture. In Threat Manager, critical assets include hosts and host groups.',l:''},'Criticality':{d:'Criticality helps you calculate risk for a host at the host and host group levels. The default criticality is 100. You can reduce this value as needed for lower priority groups of hosts, to rank your hosts across your organization.',l:''},'Customer Account':{d:'A customer account refers to the organizational-level account created in the Alert Logic User Interface. Within the Alert Logic User Interface, the Customer Account is given a unique identification number, often referred to as the \"CID\", or customer ID.',l:''},'ELB':{d:'Elastic load balancer',l:''},'event':{d:'An event is an unqualified behavior which can be considered benign or suspicious based on contextual information.',l:''},'executed saved view':{d:'Once you have created a saved view, you can schedule and execute that view. An executed saved view generates a report—based on the saved view criteria that you selected—that can be viewed in the Web portal. When you schedule and execute a view, an alert can also be created to notify when the executed saved view is performed.',l:''},'external vulnerability scan':{d:'An external vulnerability scan is used to check Internet-facing hosts for vulnerabilities to attack from the Internet.  External scans are launched from the Alert Logic Security Operations center.',l:''},'flat-file  log collector':{d:'Alert Logic\u0027s flat-file  log collector is a collector for text-based (aka \"flat-file \") log sources on Windows Server and Unix/Linux platforms. Alert Logic\u0027s flat-file  collector supports simple log formats as well as complex text log files  where a single event message might span multiple lines of text, such as XML-based logs, or where entries are delimited by a special character or string.',l:''},'Home Net':{d:'A Home Net defines the set of IP addresses that are local to an Alert Logic appliance. The Web portal displays IP addresses in the Home Net with green text.',l:''},'host group':{d:'A host group is a set of one or more hosts.',l:''},'incident':{d:'An incident is made up of correlated suspicious events that require actionable workflow to maintain your security posture and/or achieve regulatory compliance.',l:''},'instance':{d:'In cloud computing, one instance is equivalent to one virtual server or virtual machine.',l:''},'internal scan':{d:'An internal vulnerability scan is used to identify systems at risk from attack on the local, internal network. Internal scans are run from the IDS appliance.',l:''},'internal vulnerability scan':{d:'An internal vulnerability scan is used to identify systems at risk from attack on the local, internal network. Internal scans are run from the IDS appliance.',l:''},'saved view':{d:'Saved views help you to quickly and easily view a customized, dynamic report of informationd using the properties and criteria you select. Saved views are a time-saving feature that allow you to create the saved view once and use it as a template in the future.',l:''},'saved view group':{d:'Saved view groups allow users to organize and categorize saved views based on function. When you create a saved view, you can either leave the view uncategorized or specify one or more existing saved view groups that copies of the view will be added to.',l:''},'scan policy':{d:'A scan policy contains scanning options and defines the parameters for when and how a scan will execute. When you schedule a scan, you create a scan policy.',l:''},'Span session':{d:'A span session performs port mirroring used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port (or an entire VLAN) to a network monitoring connection on another switch port. This is commonly used for network appliances that require monitoring of network traffic, such as an intrusion-detection system.',l:''},'user group':{d:'A user group identifies one or more users.',l:''},'user profile':{d:'A user profile defines a template set of permissions. Using user profiles allows you to quickly assign common sets of permissions to many user accounts.',l:''},'vulnerability':{d:'A vulnerability is a weakness which can allow an attacker to reduce a system’s  information security.\n\nIn Threat Manager, vulnerabilities are used to determine the security of the system, and if, for example, patches are needed. Vulnerabilities are also used by Threat Manager to increase the accuracy of threat identification as collected information from vulnerability scans makes the Alert Logic Intrusion Detection System more target-aware.',l:''},'whitelist':{d:'A whitelist is an approved list of IP addresses that are allowed to communicate with hosts in your Threat Manager protected network.',l:''},'WLC Agent':{d:'A Windows Log Collection (WLC) Agent is a small software component which runs on the log source device directly, transparently collecting log data and transporting it back to the appliance. Agents run at a low impact to the target log source and are capable of automatic in-place upgrades.',l:''}});
